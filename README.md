# UCWA.NET
Set of .NET libraries to communicate with UCWA

# Purpose
[UCWA](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/ucwa/unifiedcommunicationswebapi2_0) contains developer resources aimed at the JavaScript developer, but no tools exist for the .NET developer.  There is fairly extensive documentation containing resource layout and samples demonstrating functionality.  With this information it should be possible to create frameworks that can interact with UCWA in any language that can communicate via HTTP.

This solution intends to provide a set of assemblies that handles the basics (transport, auto-discovery, authentication, events) and translates JSON/XML response into .NET objects.
